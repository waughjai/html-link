HTML Link
=========================

Simple class for encapsulating link info and autogenerating the HTML for it.

The 1st 2 mandatory arguments to pass into the constructor are the URL & the HTML content that will represent the link on the page ( the part that goes 'tween the opening & closing a tags ).

3rd is an optional hash map o' attributes. In addition to all the valid HTML5 attributes an a tag can have, which will automatically be added if given, adding an external attribute & setting it to true will automatically generate the HTML to securely make it open in a new tab, & adding an anchor attribute will automatically add an anchor/bookmark link to the URL ( the part after the # in a URL ).

4th is an optional hash map o' URL GET parameters that will be automatically added to the URL.
